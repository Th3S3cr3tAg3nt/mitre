# GOLD SOUTHFIELD
## ID:G0115
[GOLD SOUTHFIELD](/mitre/groups/G0115) is a financially motivated threat group active since at least 2018 that operates the [REvil](/mitre/software/S0496) Ransomware-as-a Service (RaaS). [GOLD SOUTHFIELD](/mitre/groups/G0115) provides backend infrastructure for affiliates recruited on underground forums to perpetrate high value deployments. By early 2020, [GOLD SOUTHFIELD](/mitre/groups/G0115) started capitalizing on the new trend of stealing data and further extorting the victim to pay for their data to not get publicly leaked.(Citation: Secureworks REvil September 2019)(Citation: Secureworks GandCrab and REvil September 2019)(Citation: Secureworks GOLD SOUTHFIELD)(Citation: CrowdStrike Evolution of Pinchy Spider July 2021)
