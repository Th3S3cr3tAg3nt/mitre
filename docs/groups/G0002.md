## ID:G0002
[Moafee](groups/G0002) is a threat group that appears to operate from the Guandong Province of China. Due to overlapping TTPs, including similar custom tools, Moafee is thought to have a direct or indirect relationship with the threat group [DragonOK](groups/G0017). (Citation: Haq 2014)
