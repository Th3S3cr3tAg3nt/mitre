# Scarlet Mimic
## ID:G0029
[Scarlet Mimic](groups/G0029) is a threat group that has targeted minority rights activists. This group has not been directly linked to a government source, but the group's motivations appear to overlap with those of the Chinese government. While there is some overlap between IP addresses used by [Scarlet Mimic](groups/G0029) and [Putter Panda](groups/G0024), it has not been concluded that the groups are the same.
