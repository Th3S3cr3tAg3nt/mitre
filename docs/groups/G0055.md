# NEODYMIUM
## ID:G0055
[NEODYMIUM](groups/G0055) is an activity group that conducted a campaign in May 2016 and has heavily targeted Turkish victims. The group has demonstrated similarity to another activity group called [PROMETHIUM](groups/G0056) due to overlapping victim and campaign characteristics. (Citation: Microsoft NEODYMIUM Dec 2016) (Citation: Microsoft SIR Vol 21) [NEODYMIUM](groups/G0055) is reportedly associated closely with [BlackOasis](groups/G0063) operations, but evidence that the group names are aliases has not been identified.
