# Windigo
## ID:G0124
The [Windigo](groups/G0124) group has been operating since at least 2011, compromising thousands of Linux and Unix servers using the [Ebury](software/S0377) SSH backdoor to create a spam botnet. Despite law enforcement intervention against the creators, [Windigo](groups/G0124) operators continued updating [Ebury](software/S0377) through 2019.(Citation: ESET Windigo Mar 2014)(Citation: CERN Windigo June 2019)
