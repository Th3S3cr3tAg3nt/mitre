# C0011
## ID:C0011
[C0011](/mitre/campaigns/C0011) was a suspected cyber espionage campaign conducted by [Transparent Tribe](/mitre/groups/G0134) that targeted students at universities and colleges in India. Security researchers noted this campaign against students was a significant shift from [Transparent Tribe](/mitre/groups/G0134)'s historic targeting Indian government, military, and think tank personnel, and assessed it was still ongoing as of July 2022.(Citation: Cisco Talos Transparent Tribe Education Campaign July 2022)
