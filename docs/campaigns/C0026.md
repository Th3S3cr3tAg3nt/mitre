# C0026
## ID:C0026
[C0026](campaigns/C0026) was a campaign identified in September 2022 that included the selective distribution of [KOPILUWAK](software/S1075) and [QUIETCANARY](software/S1076) malware to previous [ANDROMEDA](software/S1074) malware victims in Ukraine through re-registered [ANDROMEDA](software/S1074) C2 domains. Several tools and tactics used during [C0026](campaigns/C0026) were consistent with historic [Turla](groups/G0010) operations.(Citation: Mandiant Suspected Turla Campaign February 2023)
