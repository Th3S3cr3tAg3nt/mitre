# GoldMax
## ID:S0588
[GoldMax](/mitre/software/S0588) is a second-stage C2 backdoor written in Go with Windows and Linux variants that are nearly identical in functionality. [GoldMax](/mitre/software/S0588) was discovered in early 2021 during the investigation into the [SolarWinds Compromise](/mitre/campaigns/C0024), and has likely been used by [APT29](/mitre/groups/G0016) since at least mid-2019. [GoldMax](/mitre/software/S0588) uses multiple defense evasion techniques, including avoiding virtualization execution and masking malicious traffic.(Citation: MSTIC NOBELIUM Mar 2021)(Citation: FireEye SUNSHUTTLE Mar 2021)(Citation: CrowdStrike StellarParticle January 2022)
