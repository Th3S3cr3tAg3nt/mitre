## ID:S0477
[Goopy](/mitre/software/S0477) is a Windows backdoor and Trojan used by [APT32](/mitre/groups/G0050) and shares several similarities to another backdoor used by the group ([Denis](/mitre/software/S0354)). [Goopy](/mitre/software/S0477) is named for its impersonation of the legitimate Google Updater executable.(Citation: Cybereason Cobalt Kitty 2017)
