## ID:S0368
[NotPetya](/mitre/software/S0368) is malware that was used by [Sandworm Team](/mitre/groups/G0034) in a worldwide attack starting on June 27, 2017. While [NotPetya](/mitre/software/S0368) appears as a form of ransomware, its main purpose was to destroy data and disk structures on compromised systems; the attackers never intended to make the encrypted data recoverable. As such, [NotPetya](/mitre/software/S0368) may be more appropriately thought of as a form of wiper malware. [NotPetya](/mitre/software/S0368) contains worm-like features to spread itself across a computer network using the SMBv1 exploits EternalBlue and EternalRomance.(Citation: Talos Nyetya June 2017)(Citation: US-CERT NotPetya 2017)(Citation: ESET Telebots June 2017)(Citation: US District Court Indictment GRU Unit 74455 October 2020)
