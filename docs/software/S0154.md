# Cobalt Strike
## ID:S0154
[Cobalt Strike](/mitre/software/S0154) is a commercial, full-featured, remote access tool that bills itself as “adversary simulation software designed to execute targeted attacks and emulate the post-exploitation actions of advanced threat actors”. Cobalt Strike’s interactive post-exploit capabilities cover the full range of ATT&CK tactics, all executed within a single, integrated system.(Citation: cobaltstrike manual)

In addition to its own capabilities, [Cobalt Strike](/mitre/software/S0154) leverages the capabilities of other well-known tools such as Metasploit and [Mimikatz](/mitre/software/S0002).(Citation: cobaltstrike manual)
