# Pisloader
## ID:S0124
[Pisloader](/mitre/software/S0124) is a malware family that is notable due to its use of DNS as a C2 protocol as well as its use of anti-analysis tactics. It has been used by [APT18](/mitre/groups/G0026) and is similar to another malware family, [HTTPBrowser](/mitre/software/S0070), that has been used by the group. (Citation: Palo Alto DNS Requests)
