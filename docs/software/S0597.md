[GoldFinder](/mitre/software/S0597) is a custom HTTP tracer tool written in Go that logs the route a packet takes between a compromised network and a C2 server. It can be used to inform  threat actors of potential points of discovery or logging of their actions, including C2 related to other malware. [GoldFinder](/mitre/software/S0597) was discovered in early 2021 during an investigation into the [SolarWinds Compromise](/mitre/campaigns/C0024) by [APT29](/mitre/groups/G0016).(Citation: MSTIC NOBELIUM Mar 2021)
