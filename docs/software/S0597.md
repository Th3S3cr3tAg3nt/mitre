It can be used to inform  threat actors of potential points of discovery or logging of their actions, including C2 related to other malware. [GoldFinder](software/S0597) was discovered in early 2021 during an investigation into the [SolarWinds Compromise](campaigns/C0024) by [APT29](groups/G0016).(Citation: MSTIC NOBELIUM Mar 2021)
