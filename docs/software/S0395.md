# LightNeuron
## ID:S0395
[LightNeuron](software/S0395) is a sophisticated backdoor that has targeted Microsoft Exchange servers since at least 2014. [LightNeuron](software/S0395) has been used by [Turla](groups/G0010) to target diplomatic and foreign affairs-related organizations. The presence of certain strings in the malware suggests a Linux variant of [LightNeuron](software/S0395) exists.(Citation: ESET LightNeuron May 2019)
