# ShimRatReporter
## ID:S0445
[ShimRatReporter](software/S0445) is a tool used by suspected Chinese adversary [Mofang](groups/G0103) to automatically conduct initial discovery. The details from this discovery are used to customize follow-on payloads (such as [ShimRat](software/S0444)) as well as set up faux infrastructure which mimics the adversary's targets. [ShimRatReporter](software/S0445) has been used in campaigns targeting multiple countries and sectors including government, military, critical infrastructure, automobile, and weapons development.(Citation: FOX-IT May 2016 Mofang)
