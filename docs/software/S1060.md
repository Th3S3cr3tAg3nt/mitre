## ID:S1060
[Mafalda](software/S1060) is a flexible interactive implant that has been used by [Metador](groups/G1013). Security researchers assess the [Mafalda](software/S1060) name may be inspired by an Argentinian cartoon character that has been popular as a means of political commentary since the 1960s.
