# NGLite
## ID:S1106
[NGLite](software/S1106) is a backdoor Trojan that is only capable of running commands received through its C2 channel. While the capabilities are standard for a backdoor, NGLite uses a novel C2 channel that leverages a decentralized network based on the legitimate NKN to communicate between the backdoor and the actors.(Citation: NGLite Trojan)
