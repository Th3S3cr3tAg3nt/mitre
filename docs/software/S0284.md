# More_eggs
## ID:S0284
[More_eggs](/mitre/software/S0284) is a JScript backdoor used by [Cobalt Group](/mitre/groups/G0080) and [FIN6](/mitre/groups/G0037). Its name was given based on the variable "More_eggs" being present in its code. There are at least two different versions of the backdoor being used, version 2.0 and version 4.4.
