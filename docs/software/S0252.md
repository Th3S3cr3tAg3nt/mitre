[Brave Prince](/mitre/software/S0252) is a Korean-language implant that was first observed in the wild in December 2017. It contains similar code and behavior to [Gold Dragon](/mitre/software/S0249), and was seen along with [Gold Dragon](/mitre/software/S0249) and [RunningRAT](/mitre/software/S0253) in operations surrounding the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
