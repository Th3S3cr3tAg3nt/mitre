# COATHANGER
## ID:S1105
[COATHANGER](/mitre/software/S1105) is a remote access tool (RAT) targeting FortiGate networking appliances. First used in 2023 in targeted intrusions against military and government entities in the Netherlands along with other victims, [COATHANGER](/mitre/software/S1105) was disclosed in early 2024, with a high confidence assessment linking this malware to a state-sponsored entity in the People's Republic of China. [COATHANGER](/mitre/software/S1105) is delivered after gaining access to a FortiGate device, with in-the-wild observations linked to exploitation of CVE-2022-42475. The name [COATHANGER](/mitre/software/S1105) is based on a unique string in the malware used to encrypt configuration files on disk: <code>“She took his coat and hung it up”</code>.(Citation: NCSC-NL COATHANGER Feb 2024)
