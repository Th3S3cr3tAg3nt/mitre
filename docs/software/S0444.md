# ShimRat
## ID:S0444
[ShimRat](software/S0444) has been used by the suspected China-based adversary [Mofang](groups/G0103) in campaigns targeting multiple countries and sectors including government, military, critical infrastructure, automobile, and weapons development. The name "[ShimRat](software/S0444)" comes from the malware's extensive use of Windows Application Shimming to maintain persistence. (Citation: FOX-IT May 2016 Mofang)
