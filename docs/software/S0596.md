# ShadowPad
## ID:S0596
[ShadowPad](software/S0596) is a modular backdoor that was first identified in a supply chain compromise of the NetSarang software in mid-July 2017. The malware was originally thought to be exclusively used by [APT41](groups/G0096), but has since been observed to be used by various Chinese threat activity groups.
