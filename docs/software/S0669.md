## ID:S0669
[KOCTOPUS](software/S0669)'s batch variant is loader used by [LazyScripter](groups/G0140) since 2018 to launch [Octopus](software/S0340) and [Koadic](software/S0250) and, in some cases, [QuasarRAT](software/S0262). [KOCTOPUS](software/S0669) also has a VBA variant that has the same functionality as the batch version.(Citation: MalwareBytes LazyScripter Feb 2021)
