## ID:S0106
[cmd](software/S0106) is the Windows command-line interpreter that can be used to interact with systems and execute other processes and utilities. (Citation: TechNet Cmd)

Cmd.exe contains native functionality to perform many operations to interact with the system, including listing files in a directory (e.g., <code>dir</code> (Citation: TechNet Dir)), deleting files (e.g., <code>del</code> (Citation: TechNet Del)), and copying files (e.g., <code>copy</code> (Citation: TechNet Copy)).
