# Conti
## ID:S0575
[Conti](software/S0575) is a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) that was first observed in December 2019. [Conti](software/S0575) has been deployed via [TrickBot](software/S0266) and used against major corporations and government agencies, particularly those in North America. As with other ransomware families, actors using [Conti](software/S0575) steal sensitive files and information from compromised networks, and threaten to publish this data unless the ransom is paid.(Citation: Cybereason Conti Jan 2021)(Citation: CarbonBlack Conti July 2020)(Citation: Cybleinc Conti January 2020)
