# PoshC2
## ID:S0378
[PoshC2](/mitre/software/S0378) is an open source remote administration and post-exploitation framework that is publicly available on GitHub. The server-side components of the tool are primarily written in Python, while the implants are written in [PowerShell](/mitre/techniques/T1059/001). Although [PoshC2](/mitre/software/S0378) is primarily focused on Windows implantation, it does contain a basic Python dropper for Linux/macOS.(Citation: GitHub PoshC2)
