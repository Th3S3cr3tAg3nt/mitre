## ID:S0266
[TrickBot](software/S0266) is a Trojan spyware program written in C++ that first emerged in September 2016 as a possible successor to [Dyre](software/S0024). [TrickBot](software/S0266) was developed and initially used by [Wizard Spider](groups/G0102) for targeting banking sites in North America, Australia, and throughout Europe; it has since been used against all sectors worldwide as part of "big game hunting" ransomware campaigns.(Citation: S2 Grupo TrickBot June 2017)(Citation: Fidelis TrickBot Oct 2016)(Citation: IBM TrickBot Nov 2016)(Citation: CrowdStrike Wizard Spider October 2020)
