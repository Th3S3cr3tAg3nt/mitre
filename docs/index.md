# Mitre Attack Framework

MITRE ATT&CKÂ® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.

This is a dynamically generated markdown version of ATT&CK for use with Obsidian and other personal projects.
