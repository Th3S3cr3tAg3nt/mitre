# System Network Configuration Discovery
## ID:T1016
Adversaries may look for details about the network configuration and settings, such as IP and/or MAC addresses, of systems they access or through information discovery of remote systems. Several operating system administration utilities exist that can be used to gather this information. Examples include [Arp](/mitre/software/S0099), [ipconfig](/mitre/software/S0100)/[ifconfig](/mitre/software/S0101), [nbtstat](/mitre/software/S0102), and [route](/mitre/software/S0103).

Adversaries may also leverage a [Network Device CLI](/mitre/techniques/T1059/008) on network devices to gather information about configurations and settings, such as IP addresses of configured interfaces and static/dynamic routes (e.g. <code>show ip route</code>, <code>show ip interface</code>).(Citation: US-CERT-TA18-106A)(Citation: Mandiant APT41 Global Intrusion )

Adversaries may use the information from [System Network Configuration Discovery](/mitre/techniques/T1016) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including determining certain access within the target network and what actions to do next.
