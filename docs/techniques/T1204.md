# User Execution
## ID:T1204
An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution. Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to execute malicious code by, for example, opening a malicious document file or link. These user actions will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from forms of [Phishing](/mitre/techniques/T1566).

While [User Execution](/mitre/techniques/T1204) frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it. This activity may also be seen shortly after [Internal Spearphishing](/mitre/techniques/T1534).

Adversaries may also deceive users into performing actions such as enabling [Remote Access Software](/mitre/techniques/T1219), allowing direct control of the system to the adversary; running malicious JavaScript in their browser, allowing adversaries to [Steal Web Session Cookie](/mitre/techniques/T1539)s; or downloading and executing malware for [User Execution](/mitre/techniques/T1204).(Citation: Talos Roblox Scam 2023)(Citation: Krebs Discord Bookmarks 2023)

For example, tech support scams can be facilitated through [Phishing](/mitre/techniques/T1566), vishing, or various forms of user interaction. Adversaries can use a combination of these methods, such as spoofing and promoting toll-free numbers or call centers that are used to direct victims to malicious websites, to deliver and execute payloads containing malware or [Remote Access Software](/mitre/techniques/T1219).(Citation: Telephone Attack Delivery)
