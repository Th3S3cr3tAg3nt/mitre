## ID:T1584/004
Adversaries may compromise third-party servers that can be used during targeting. Use of servers allows an adversary to stage, launch, and execute an operation. During post-compromise activity, adversaries may utilize servers for various tasks, including for Command and Control.(Citation: TrendMicro EarthLusca 2022) Instead of purchasing a [Server](/mitre/techniques/T1583/004) or [Virtual Private Server](/mitre/techniques/T1583/003), adversaries may compromise third-party servers in support of operations.

Adversaries may also compromise web servers to support watering hole operations, as in [Drive-by Compromise](/mitre/techniques/T1189), or email servers to support [Phishing](/mitre/techniques/T1566) operations.
