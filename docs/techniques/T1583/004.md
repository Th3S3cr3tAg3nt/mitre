# Server
## ID:T1583/004
Adversaries may buy, lease, rent, or obtain physical serversÂ that can be used during targeting. Use of servers allows an adversary to stage, launch, and execute an operation. During post-compromise activity, adversaries may utilize servers for various tasks, such as watering hole operations in [Drive-by Compromise](/mitre/techniques/T1189), enabling [Phishing](/mitre/techniques/T1566) operations, or facilitating [Command and Control](/mitre/tactics/TA0011). Instead of compromising a third-party [Server](/mitre/techniques/T1584/004) or renting a [Virtual Private Server](/mitre/techniques/T1583/003), adversaries may opt to configure and run their own servers in support of operations. Free trial periods of cloud servers may also be abused.(Citation: Free Trial PurpleUrchin)(Citation: Freejacked) 

Adversaries may only need a lightweight setup if most of their activities will take place using online infrastructure. Or, they may need to build extensive infrastructure if they want to test, communicate, and control other aspects of their activities on their own systems.(Citation: NYTStuxnet)
