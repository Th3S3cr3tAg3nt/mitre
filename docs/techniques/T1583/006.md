# Web Services
## ID:T1583/006
Adversaries may register for web servicesÂ that can be used during targeting. A variety of popular websites exist for adversaries to register for a web-based service that can be abused during later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control ([Web Service](/mitre/techniques/T1102)), [Exfiltration Over Web Service](/mitre/techniques/T1567), or [Phishing](/mitre/techniques/T1566). Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise.(Citation: FireEye APT29) By utilizing a web service, adversaries can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to them.
