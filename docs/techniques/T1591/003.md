# Identify Business Tempo
## ID:T1591/003
Adversaries may gather information about the victim's business tempo that can be used during targeting. Information about an organization’s business tempo may include a variety of details, including operational hours/days of the week. This information may also reveal times/dates of purchases and shipments of the victim’s hardware and software resources.

Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation via [Phishing for Information](techniques/T1598). Information about business tempo may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: [Social Media](techniques/T1593/001) or [Search Victim-Owned Websites](techniques/T1594)).(Citation: ThreatPost Broadvoice Leak) Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Phishing for Information](techniques/T1598) or [Search Open Websites/Domains](techniques/T1593)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Establish Accounts](techniques/T1585) or [Compromise Accounts](techniques/T1586)), and/or initial access (ex: [Supply Chain Compromise](techniques/T1195) or [Trusted Relationship](techniques/T1199))
