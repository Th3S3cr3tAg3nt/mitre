# Identify Roles
## ID:T1591/004
Adversaries may gather information about identities and roles within the victim organization that can be used during targeting. Information about business roles may reveal a variety of targetable details, including identifiable information for key personnel as well as what data/resources they have access to.

Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation via [Phishing for Information](techniques/T1598). Information about business roles may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: [Social Media](techniques/T1593/001) or [Search Victim-Owned Websites](techniques/T1594)).(Citation: ThreatPost Broadvoice Leak) Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Phishing for Information](techniques/T1598) or [Search Open Websites/Domains](techniques/T1593)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Establish Accounts](techniques/T1585) or [Compromise Accounts](techniques/T1586)), and/or initial access (ex: [Phishing](techniques/T1566)).
