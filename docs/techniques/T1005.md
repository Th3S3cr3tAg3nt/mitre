# Data from Local System
## ID:T1005

Adversaries may do this using a [Command and Scripting Interpreter](/mitre/techniques/T1059), such as [cmd](/mitre/software/S0106) as well as a [Network Device CLI](/mitre/techniques/T1059/008), which have functionality to interact with the file system to gather information.(Citation: show_run_config_cmd_cisco) Adversaries may also use [Automated Collection](/mitre/techniques/T1119) on the local system.
