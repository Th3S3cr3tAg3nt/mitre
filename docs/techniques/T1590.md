# Gather Victim Network Information
## ID:T1590
Adversaries may gather information about the victim's networks that can be used during targeting. Information about networks may include a variety of details, including administrative data (ex: IP ranges, domain names, etc.) as well as specifics regarding its topology and operations.

Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via [Active Scanning](techniques/T1595) or [Phishing for Information](techniques/T1598). Information about networks may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: [Search Open Technical Databases](techniques/T1596)).(Citation: WHOIS)(Citation: DNS Dumpster)(Citation: Circl Passive DNS) Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Active Scanning](techniques/T1595) or [Search Open Websites/Domains](techniques/T1593)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Acquire Infrastructure](techniques/T1583) or [Compromise Infrastructure](techniques/T1584)), and/or initial access (ex: [Trusted Relationship](techniques/T1199)).
