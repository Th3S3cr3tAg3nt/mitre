# Gather Victim Host Information
## ID:T1592
Adversaries may gather information about the victim's hosts that can be used during targeting. Information about hosts may include a variety of details, including administrative data (ex: name, assigned IP, functionality, etc.) as well as specifics regarding its configuration (ex: operating system, language, etc.).

Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via [Active Scanning](/mitre/techniques/T1595) or [Phishing for Information](/mitre/techniques/T1598). Adversaries may also compromise sites then include malicious content designed to collect host information from visitors.(Citation: ATT ScanBox) Information about hosts may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: [Social Media](/mitre/techniques/T1593/001) or [Search Victim-Owned Websites](/mitre/techniques/T1594)). Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Search Open Websites/Domains](/mitre/techniques/T1593) or [Search Open Technical Databases](/mitre/techniques/T1596)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Develop Capabilities](/mitre/techniques/T1587) or [Obtain Capabilities](/mitre/techniques/T1588)), and/or initial access (ex: [Supply Chain Compromise](/mitre/techniques/T1195) or [External Remote Services](/mitre/techniques/T1133)).
