# Automated Collection
## ID:T1119
Once established within a system or network, an adversary may use automated techniques for collecting internal data. Methods for performing this technique could include use of a [Command and Scripting Interpreter](/mitre/techniques/T1059) to search for and copy information fitting set criteria such as file type, location, or name at specific time intervals. 

In cloud-based environments, adversaries may also use cloud APIs, data pipelines, command line interfaces, or extract, transform, and load (ETL) services to automatically collect data.(Citation: Mandiant UNC3944 SMS Phishing 2023) 

This functionality could also be built into remote access tools. 

This technique may incorporate use of other techniques such as [File and Directory Discovery](/mitre/techniques/T1083) and [Lateral Tool Transfer](/mitre/techniques/T1570) to identify and move files, as well as [Cloud Service Dashboard](/mitre/techniques/T1538) and [Cloud Storage Object Discovery](/mitre/techniques/T1619) to identify resources in cloud environments.
