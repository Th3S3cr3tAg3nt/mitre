# Vulnerability Scanning
## ID:T1595/002
Adversaries may scan victims for vulnerabilities that can be used during targeting. Vulnerability scans typically check if the configuration of a target host/application (ex: software and version) potentially aligns with the target of a specific exploit the adversary may seek to use.

These scans may also include more broad attempts to [Gather Victim Host Information](/mitre/techniques/T1592) that can be used to identify more commonly known, exploitable vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scans typically harvest running software and version numbers via server banners, listening ports, or other network artifacts.(Citation: OWASP Vuln Scanning) Information from these scans may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Search Open Websites/Domains](/mitre/techniques/T1593) or [Search Open Technical Databases](/mitre/techniques/T1596)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Develop Capabilities](/mitre/techniques/T1587) or [Obtain Capabilities](/mitre/techniques/T1588)), and/or initial access (ex: [Exploit Public-Facing Application](/mitre/techniques/T1190)).
