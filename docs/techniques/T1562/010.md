# Downgrade Attack
## ID:T1562/010
Adversaries may downgrade or use a version of system features that may be outdated, vulnerable, and/or does not support updated security controls. Downgrade attacks typically take advantage of a systemâ€™s backward compatibility to force it into less secure modes of operation. 

Adversaries may downgrade and use various less-secure versions of features of a system, such as [Command and Scripting Interpreter](techniques/T1059)s or even network protocols that can be abused to enable [Adversary-in-the-Middle](techniques/T1557) or [Network Sniffing](techniques/T1040).(Citation: Praetorian TLS Downgrade Attack 2014) For example, [PowerShell](techniques/T1059/001) versions 5+ includes Script Block Logging (SBL) which can record executed script content. However, adversaries may attempt to execute a previous version of PowerShell that does not support SBL with the intent to [Impair Defenses](techniques/T1562) while running malicious scripts that may have otherwise been detected.(Citation: CrowdStrike BGH Ransomware 2021)(Citation: Mandiant BYOL 2018)(Citation: att_def_ps_logging)

Adversaries may similarly target network traffic to downgrade from an encrypted HTTPS connection to an unsecured HTTP connection that exposes network data in clear text.(Citation: Targeted SSL Stripping Attacks Are Real)(Citation: Crowdstrike Downgrade)
