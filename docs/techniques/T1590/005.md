# IP Addresses
## ID:T1590/005
Adversaries may gather the victim's IP addresses that can be used during targeting. Public IP addresses may be allocated to organizations by block, or a range of sequential addresses. Information about assigned IP addresses may include a variety of details, such as which IP addresses are in use. IP addresses may also enable an adversary to derive other details about a victim, such as organizational size, physical location(s), Internet service provider, and or where/how their publicly-facing infrastructure is hosted.

Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via [Active Scanning](techniques/T1595) or [Phishing for Information](techniques/T1598). Information about assigned IP addresses may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: [Search Open Technical Databases](techniques/T1596)).(Citation: WHOIS)(Citation: DNS Dumpster)(Citation: Circl Passive DNS) Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Active Scanning](techniques/T1595) or [Search Open Websites/Domains](techniques/T1593)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Acquire Infrastructure](techniques/T1583) or [Compromise Infrastructure](techniques/T1584)), and/or initial access (ex: [External Remote Services](techniques/T1133)).
