# Network Trust Dependencies
## ID:T1590/003
Adversaries may gather information about the victim's network trust dependencies that can be used during targeting. Information about network trusts may include a variety of details, including second or third-party organizations/domains (ex: managed service providers, contractors, etc.) that have connected (and potentially elevated) network access.

Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation via [Phishing for Information](/mitre/techniques/T1598). Information about network trusts may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: [Search Open Technical Databases](/mitre/techniques/T1596)).(Citation: Pentesting AD Forests) Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Active Scanning](/mitre/techniques/T1595) or [Search Open Websites/Domains](/mitre/techniques/T1593)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Acquire Infrastructure](/mitre/techniques/T1583) or [Compromise Infrastructure](/mitre/techniques/T1584)), and/or initial access (ex: [Trusted Relationship](/mitre/techniques/T1199)).
