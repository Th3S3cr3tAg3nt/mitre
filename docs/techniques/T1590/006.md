# Network Security Appliances
## ID:T1590/006
Adversaries may gather information about the victim's network security appliances that can be used during targeting. Information about network security appliances may include a variety of details, such as the existence and specifics of deployed firewalls, content filters, and proxies/bastion hosts. Adversaries may also target information about victim network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS) or other appliances related to defensive cybersecurity operations.

Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via [Active Scanning](techniques/T1595) or [Phishing for Information](techniques/T1598).(Citation: Nmap Firewalls NIDS) Information about network security appliances may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: [Search Victim-Owned Websites](techniques/T1594)). Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Search Open Technical Databases](techniques/T1596) or [Search Open Websites/Domains](techniques/T1593)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Develop Capabilities](techniques/T1587) or [Obtain Capabilities](techniques/T1588)), and/or initial access (ex: [External Remote Services](techniques/T1133)).
