# Employee Names
## ID:T1589/003
Adversaries may gather employee names that can be used during targeting. Employee names be used to derive email addresses as well as to help guide other reconnaissance efforts and/or craft more-believable lures.

Adversaries may easily gather employee names, since they may be readily available and exposed via online or other accessible data sets (ex: [Social Media](techniques/T1593/001) or [Search Victim-Owned Websites](techniques/T1594)).(Citation: OPM Leak) Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Search Open Websites/Domains](techniques/T1593) or [Phishing for Information](techniques/T1598)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Compromise Accounts](techniques/T1586)), and/or initial access (ex: [Phishing](techniques/T1566) or [Valid Accounts](techniques/T1078)).
