# Email Addresses
## ID:T1589/002
Adversaries may gather email addresses that can be used during targeting. Even if internal instances exist, organizations may have public-facing email infrastructure and addresses for employees.

Adversaries may easily gather email addresses, since they may be readily available and exposed via online or other accessible data sets (ex: [Social Media](/mitre/techniques/T1593/001) or [Search Victim-Owned Websites](/mitre/techniques/T1594)).(Citation: HackersArise Email)(Citation: CNET Leaks) Email addresses could also be enumerated via more active means (i.e. [Active Scanning](/mitre/techniques/T1595)), such as probing and analyzing responses from authentication services that may reveal valid usernames in a system.(Citation: GrimBlog UsernameEnum) For example, adversaries may be able to enumerate email addresses in Office 365 environments by querying a variety of publicly available API endpoints, such as autodiscover and GetCredentialType.(Citation: GitHub Office 365 User Enumeration)(Citation: Azure Active Directory Reconnaisance)

Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Search Open Websites/Domains](/mitre/techniques/T1593) or [Phishing for Information](/mitre/techniques/T1598)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Email Accounts](/mitre/techniques/T1586/002)), and/or initial access (ex: [Phishing](/mitre/techniques/T1566) or [Brute Force](/mitre/techniques/T1110) via [External Remote Services](/mitre/techniques/T1133)).
