# Gather Victim Org Information
## ID:T1591
Adversaries may gather information about the victim's organization that can be used during targeting. Information about an organization may include a variety of details, including the names of divisions/departments, specifics of business operations, as well as the roles and responsibilities of key employees.

Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation via [Phishing for Information](techniques/T1598). Information about an organization may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: [Social Media](techniques/T1593/001) or [Search Victim-Owned Websites](techniques/T1594)).(Citation: ThreatPost Broadvoice Leak)(Citation: SEC EDGAR Search) Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Phishing for Information](techniques/T1598) or [Search Open Websites/Domains](techniques/T1593)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Establish Accounts](techniques/T1585) or [Compromise Accounts](techniques/T1586)), and/or initial access (ex: [Phishing](techniques/T1566) or [Trusted Relationship](techniques/T1199)).
