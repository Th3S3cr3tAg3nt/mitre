# Disk Wipe
## ID:T1561
Adversaries may wipe or corrupt raw disk data on specific systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources. With direct write access to a disk, adversaries may attempt to overwrite portions of disk data. Adversaries may opt to wipe arbitrary portions of disk data and/or wipe disk structures like the master boot record (MBR). A complete wipe of all disk sectors may be attempted.

To maximize impact on the target organization in operations where network-wide availability interruption is the goal, malware used for wiping disks may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging additional techniques like [Valid Accounts](/mitre/techniques/T1078), [OS Credential Dumping](/mitre/techniques/T1003), and [SMB/Windows Admin Shares](/mitre/techniques/T1021/002).(Citation: Novetta Blockbuster Destructive Malware)

On network devices, adversaries may wipe configuration files and other data from the device using [Network Device CLI](/mitre/techniques/T1059/008) commands such as `erase`.(Citation: erase_cmd_cisco)
