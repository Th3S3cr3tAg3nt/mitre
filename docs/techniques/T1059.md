# Command and Scripting Interpreter
## ID:T1059
Adversaries may abuse command and script interpreters to execute commands, scripts, or binaries. These interfaces and languages provide ways of interacting with computer systems and are a common feature across many different platforms. Most systems come with some built-in command-line interface and scripting capabilities, for example, macOS and Linux distributions include some flavor of [Unix Shell](/mitre/techniques/T1059/004) while Windows installations include the [Windows Command Shell](/mitre/techniques/T1059/003) and [PowerShell](/mitre/techniques/T1059/001).

There are also cross-platform interpreters such as [Python](/mitre/techniques/T1059/006), as well as those commonly associated with client applications such as [JavaScript](/mitre/techniques/T1059/007) and [Visual Basic](/mitre/techniques/T1059/005).

Adversaries may abuse these technologies in various ways as a means of executing arbitrary commands. Commands and scripts can be embedded in [Initial Access](/mitre/tactics/TA0001) payloads delivered to victims as lure documents or as secondary payloads downloaded from an existing C2. Adversaries may also execute commands through interactive terminals/shells, as well as utilize various [Remote Services](/mitre/techniques/T1021) in order to achieve remote Execution.(Citation: Powershell Remote Commands)(Citation: Cisco IOS Software Integrity Assurance - Command History)(Citation: Remote Shell Execution in Python)
