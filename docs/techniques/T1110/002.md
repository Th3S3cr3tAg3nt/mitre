# Password Cracking
## ID:T1110/002
Adversaries may use password cracking to attempt to recover usable credentials, such as plaintext passwords, when credential material such as password hashes are obtained. [OS Credential Dumping](/mitre/techniques/T1003) can be used to obtain password hashes, this may only get an adversary so far when [Pass the Hash](/mitre/techniques/T1550/002) is not an option. Further,  adversaries may leverage [Data from Configuration Repository](/mitre/techniques/T1602) in order to obtain hashed credentials for network devices.(Citation: US-CERT-TA18-106A) 

Techniques to systematically guess the passwords used to compute hashes are available, or the adversary may use a pre-computed rainbow table to crack hashes. Cracking hashes is usually done on adversary-controlled systems outside of the target network.(Citation: Wikipedia Password cracking) The resulting plaintext password resulting from a successfully cracked hash may be used to log into systems, resources, and services in which the account has access.
