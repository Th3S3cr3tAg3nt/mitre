# Email Accounts
## ID:T1585/002
Adversaries may create email accounts that can be used during targeting. Adversaries can use accounts created with email providers to further their operations, such as leveraging them to conduct [Phishing for Information](/mitre/techniques/T1598) or [Phishing](/mitre/techniques/T1566).(Citation: Mandiant APT1) Establishing email accounts may also allow adversaries to abuse free services – such as trial periods – to [Acquire Infrastructure](/mitre/techniques/T1583) for follow-on purposes.(Citation: Free Trial PurpleUrchin)

Adversaries may also take steps to cultivate a persona around the email account, such as through use of [Social Media Accounts](/mitre/techniques/T1585/001), to increase the chance of success of follow-on behaviors. Created email accounts can also be used in the acquisition of infrastructure (ex: [Domains](/mitre/techniques/T1583/001)).(Citation: Mandiant APT1)

To decrease the chance of physically tying back operations to themselves, adversaries may make use of disposable email services.(Citation: Trend Micro R980 2016)
