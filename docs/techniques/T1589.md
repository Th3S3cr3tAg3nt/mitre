# Gather Victim Identity Information
## ID:T1589
Adversaries may gather information about the victim's identity that can be used during targeting. Information about identities may include a variety of details, including personal data (ex: employee names, email addresses, security question responses, etc.) as well as sensitive details such as credentials or multi-factor authentication (MFA) configurations.

Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation via [Phishing for Information](/mitre/techniques/T1598). Information about users could also be enumerated via other active means (i.e. [Active Scanning](/mitre/techniques/T1595)) such as probing and analyzing responses from authentication services that may reveal valid usernames in a system or permitted MFA /methods associated with those usernames.(Citation: GrimBlog UsernameEnum)(Citation: Obsidian SSPR Abuse 2023) Information about victims may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: [Social Media](/mitre/techniques/T1593/001) or [Search Victim-Owned Websites](/mitre/techniques/T1594)).(Citation: OPM Leak)(Citation: Register Deloitte)(Citation: Register Uber)(Citation: Detectify Slack Tokens)(Citation: Forbes GitHub Creds)(Citation: GitHub truffleHog)(Citation: GitHub Gitrob)(Citation: CNET Leaks)

Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Search Open Websites/Domains](/mitre/techniques/T1593) or [Phishing for Information](/mitre/techniques/T1598)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Compromise Accounts](/mitre/techniques/T1586)), and/or initial access (ex: [Phishing](/mitre/techniques/T1566) or [Valid Accounts](/mitre/techniques/T1078)).
