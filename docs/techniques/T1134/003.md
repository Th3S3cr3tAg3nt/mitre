# Make and Impersonate Token
## ID:T1134/003
Adversaries may make new tokens and impersonate users to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. For example, if an adversary has a username and password but the user is not logged onto the system the adversary can then create a logon session for the user using the `LogonUser` function.(Citation: LogonUserW function) The function will return a copy of the new session's access token and the adversary can use `SetThreadToken` to assign the token to a thread.

This behavior is distinct from [Token Impersonation/Theft](/mitre/techniques/T1134/001) in that this refers to creating a new user token instead of stealing or duplicating an existing one.
