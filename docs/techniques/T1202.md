# Indirect Command Execution
## ID:T1202
Adversaries may abuse utilities that allow for command execution to bypass security restrictions that limit the use of command-line interpreters. Various Windows utilities may be used to execute commands, possibly without invoking [cmd](/mitre/software/S0106). For example, [Forfiles](/mitre/software/S0193), the Program Compatibility Assistant (pcalua.exe), components of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), as well as other utilities may invoke the execution of programs and commands from a [Command and Scripting Interpreter](/mitre/techniques/T1059), Run window, or via scripts.

Adversaries may abuse these features for [Defense Evasion](/mitre/tactics/TA0005), specifically to perform arbitrary execution while subverting detections and/or mitigation controls (such as Group Policy) that limit/prevent the usage of [cmd](/mitre/software/S0106) or file extensions more commonly associated with malicious payloads.
