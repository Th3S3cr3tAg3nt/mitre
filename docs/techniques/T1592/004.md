# Client Configurations
## ID:T1592/004
Adversaries may gather information about the victim's client configurations that can be used during targeting. Information about client configurations may include a variety of details and settings, including operating system/version, virtualization, architecture (ex: 32 or 64 bit), language, and/or time zone.

Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via [Active Scanning](techniques/T1595) (ex: listening ports, server banners, user agent strings) or [Phishing for Information](techniques/T1598). Adversaries may also compromise sites then include malicious content designed to collect host information from visitors.(Citation: ATT ScanBox) Information about the client configurations may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: job postings, network maps, assessment reports, resumes, or purchase invoices). Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Search Open Websites/Domains](techniques/T1593) or [Search Open Technical Databases](techniques/T1596)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Develop Capabilities](techniques/T1587) or [Obtain Capabilities](techniques/T1588)), and/or initial access (ex: [Supply Chain Compromise](techniques/T1195) or [External Remote Services](techniques/T1133)).
