# Malicious Link
## ID:T1204/001
An adversary may rely upon a user clicking a malicious link in order to gain execution. Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to click on a link that will lead to code execution. This user action will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from [Spearphishing Link](/mitre/techniques/T1566/002). Clicking on a link may also lead to other execution techniques such as exploitation of a browser or application vulnerability via [Exploitation for Client Execution](/mitre/techniques/T1203). Links may also lead users to download files that require execution via [Malicious File](/mitre/techniques/T1204/002).
