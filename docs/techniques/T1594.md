# Search Victim-Owned Websites
## ID:T1594
Adversaries may search websites owned by the victim for information that can be used during targeting. Victim-owned websites may contain a variety of details, including names of departments/divisions, physical locations, and data about key employees such as names, roles, and contact info (ex: [Email Addresses](/mitre/techniques/T1589/002)). These sites may also have details highlighting business operations and relationships.(Citation: Comparitech Leak)

Adversaries may search victim-owned websites to gather actionable information. Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Phishing for Information](/mitre/techniques/T1598) or [Search Open Technical Databases](/mitre/techniques/T1596)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Establish Accounts](/mitre/techniques/T1585) or [Compromise Accounts](/mitre/techniques/T1586)), and/or initial access (ex: [Trusted Relationship](/mitre/techniques/T1199) or [Phishing](/mitre/techniques/T1566)).
